These are the most near term feasible, but have a limited impact, as the ability of organisms to slow the aging process indefinitely is simply not present in biology. 2 is replacement. I think this has the greatest capability for near-term (10-20 years) large gains (10+ years) in lifespan. New hearts, new neurons, new skin, vasculature, etc. Plus the benefits don't only go to aging. Probably the most feasible place to start is the immune system.  3 is the genetic engineering stuff. You can theoretically reprogram cells to be highly resistant to aging (we don't know how yet, but with the capacity to add enough information, it should be possible).  There are huge technological hurdles as well as chasms of knowledge to traverse.  However, there's some overlap with 2, where you can start engineering replacement cells that are more resistant to ageing and use that as a proving ground for further tinkering.

So for example, I think anti-AGE compounds could extend lifespan for diabetics for ~10 years, I think in 25 years we will have good strategies overall, and diabetes is common. Conversely I think artificial organs may be more directly helpful for those who need them (i.e. replacement or synthetic heart for heart failure patient), but there is more uncertainty, potentially more resistance to uptake, and this may apply to a smaller fraction of people. Additionally I think to get much beyond 20 year lifespan extension we will need to have most bases covered, thus even if individual therapies can push the needle a few years there may be a plateau until all things come together. Lastly, I am bullish about the 25 year timeframe, but for anything not already in clinical trials I don't expect it to impact societal lifespan in 5 years, maybe not in 10 either.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,2,,2,1,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,5,,2,7,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,,,17,,2,14,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,2,,2,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,2,,1,2,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,2,,1,2,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,2,,2,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,3,,1,1,,,2,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,,Neutral,0,0,,,other
