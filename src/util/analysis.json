Longevity experiments naturally take time (especially if lifespan needs to be observed). Progress is limited by the number of well-designed experiments that can be run. For example, if running a reprogramming experiment takes you 20 days and your lab is only equipped to run one of these experiments at a time, then you are majorly limited by your iteration speed.
